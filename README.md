The project shows how to create a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Microsoft Azure that uses the Olympic data as an example.

It goes through each step involved in a data pipeline : ingestion, transformation, storage, to show how raw data can be transformed and turned into reflective insights.

We use Data Factory for Data ingestion, Data Lake Gen 2 for Raw Data Store, Databricks for Data Transformation and finally Data Lake Gen 2 again to keep the transformed Data.
